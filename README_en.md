## Usage

Choose the desired cell size for the template. Two options available: 100mm and 17mm.

Write down the template contents, or select one of the predefined ones listed below.

Click on the "Update" (Actualizar) button for refreshing the template content. Clicking the "Copy Link" (Copiar Enlace) button, a
permalink to the current template contents is copied to the clipboard that can be shared with other people.

Once the template is ready, use the Print feature of the browser. Currently, the crossing lines in the cells cannot be printed from
an Android device. To get them printed, use a Computer and make sure that the option to print "background images" is enabled.

Printing to PDF is another great way to share your work with other people.

## Template syntax

The syntax is as follows:

- An empty line generates an empty template row
- Each line must be composed of an even number of words separated by spaces. In each pair of words, the first word is the pinyin
  transcription, and the second one contains the hanzi

Use the small keyboard below the template edit box to insert special vowels. The character will be inserted at the current position.
